# 🫁 Pulmonary Disease Predictor

This is a Flask-based web application that predicts the likelihood of Pulmonary Disease in a patient based on health-related inputs like smoking habits, oxygen saturation, chest tightness, and more.

It uses a trained **XGBoost classification model** under the hood to make predictions in real-time via a simple, responsive web form.
